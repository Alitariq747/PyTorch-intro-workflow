Introduction
PyTorch is a powerful deep learning framework that provides flexibility and dynamic computation graphs. This workbook is designed to serve as an entry point for individuals new to PyTorch, offering a hands-on experience with building and training a simple linear regression model.

Content Overview
The workbook covers the following key aspects:

Dataset Creation: Illustration of creating a synthetic dataset suitable for a linear regression task.

Model Architecture: Introduction to defining a linear regression model using PyTorch's nn.Module.

Training and Testing Loops: Implementation of training and testing loops to optimize the model's parameters and assess its performance.

Evaluation: Examination of model performance on test data and visualization of results.

Saving and Loading a Model: Guidance on how to save a trained model to disk and load it for further use.

Notebook Structure
The workbook is organized into sections that progressively build upon each other. The sections include:

Dataset Creation: Generating synthetic data points.

Model Definition: Creating a simple linear regression model.

Training Loop: Iterating over the dataset to optimize the model.

Testing Loop: Evaluating the model's performance on a separate test dataset.

Visualization: Plotting the original data, model predictions, and evaluation metrics.

Saving and Loading: Demonstrating how to save the trained model and reload it.

Key Concepts
PyTorch Tensors: Introduction to the basic data structure in PyTorch.

Linear Regression Model: Overview of a simple linear regression model.

Loss Function: Explanation of the loss function used for training.
